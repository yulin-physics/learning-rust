# Rust in Action

## Lifetime Annotations

Lifetimes provide specific information to the Rust compiler about data that lives outside a function (functions that use references). Make sure input data lives as long as the function.

Lifetime elision - lifetime parameters don't need to be provided usually.

## Generics

Handle many possible input types to functions, define in function signature by capital letters.

## Trait bounds

Add constraints to generics. A trait is analogous to an interface or protocol in other domains.
